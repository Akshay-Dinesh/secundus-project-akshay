      <h2>Norway</h2>
      <p>Norway’s cold climate and coastal geography have made fish, especially cod and salmon, central to its cuisine. Preservation methods like drying, curing, and fermenting were vital for long winters, leading to iconic dishes such as rakfisk and gravlaks.</p>

      <h2>Japan</h2>
      <p>As an island nation with mountainous terrain, Japan relies heavily on the sea. Its cuisine features seafood, rice, and seasonal vegetables.
