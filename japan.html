      <p>Japan’s mountainous terrain and surrounding seas play a major role in shaping its cuisine. With limited farmland, rice cultivation thrives in the flat coastal plains, making rice the staple of the Japanese diet. Surrounded by rich fishing waters, Japan is known for its seafood-based dishes like sushi and sashimi. The country’s four seasons also influence seasonal eating and preservation techniques like pickling.</p>
